# functions

Contains the source code for AWS Lambda functions used by the TMI band web
site. This was originally used as a way to get around caches that were
preventing page updates. The cache settings have since been updated, but the
functions are still in place. Updating these functions is painless enough
to continue using Lambda functions as long as they're cost effective.
